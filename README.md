# wizardDuel
wizard duel game made in javascript using phaser and socket.io

can be played at: https://wizarduel.herokuapp.com/

I realize this is some quality spaghetti code right here and i have no excuse other than... ITS FREE.
2 players only.
As of right now has NO lobbies, so when more than 2 players connect, everyone seems to control 1 mage, while everyone else controls the other. Check to see what i mean.
